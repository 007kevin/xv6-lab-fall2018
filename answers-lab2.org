1. Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type should variable x have, uintptr_t or physaddr_t?
   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     mystery_t x;
     char* value = return_a_pointer();
     *value = 10;
     x = (mystery_t) value;   
   #+END_SRC
   Answer
   x should be of type uintptr_t virtual address type since executing code pointers are virtual addresses
   that are always translated by the MMU
